# Terminal-Based Chat Application with Multithreading

This is a simple terminal-based chat application implemented in Python, enabling real-time communication between multiple users. It uses **sockets** for network communication and **multithreading** to handle multiple clients concurrently.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Enables instant messaging between clients connected to the same server.
- **Multithreading**: Uses Python's `threading` module to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- **Server-Client Architecture**: The server listens for incoming client connections, and clients communicate with each other through the server.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Sockets** for network communication
- **Threading** for concurrency

## Getting Started
